Prostate data info

The data for this example come from a study by Stamey et al. (1989). Theyexamined the correlation between the level of prostate-specific antigen anda number of clinical measures in men who were about to receive a radicalprostatectomy. 

The variables are 

log cancer volume (lcavol), 
log prostate weight (lweight), 
age, 
log of the amount of benign prostatic hyperplasia (lbph), 
seminal vesicle invasion (svi), 
log of capsular penetration (lcp),Gleason score (gleason), and 
percent of Gleason scores 4 or 5 (pgg45).


Predictors (columns 1--8)

train/test indicator (column 10)

This last column indicates which 67 observations were used as the 
"training set" and which 30 as the test set, as described on page 48
in the book.

The features must first be scaled to have mean zero and unit variance 96 (=n)
before the analyses in Tables 3.1 and beyond.  That is, if x is the  96 by 8 matrix
of features, we compute xp <- scale(x,TRUE,TRUE)
